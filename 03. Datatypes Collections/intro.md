# Collection data types

In addition to the basic data types like integers, floats, and strings, Python provides several built-in collection data types that allow you to store and manage groups of related data. The most commonly used collection data types in Python are:

- **Lists**: Ordered, mutable collections of items. Lists can contain items of different data types.
  ```python
  my_list = [1, 2, 3, 'hello', 4.5]
  ```
- **Tuples**: Ordered, immutable collections of items. Once created, the items in a tuple cannot be changed.
  ```python
    my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 'hello', 4.5)
    ```
- **Sets**: Unordered collections of unique items. Sets do not allow duplicate values.
  ```python
    my_set = {1, 2, 3, 'hello', 4.5}
    ```
- **Dictionaries**: Unordered collections of key-value pairs. Each key must be unique, and values can be of any data type.
  ```python
    my_dict = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}
    ```
These collection data types provide powerful ways to organize and manipulate data in Python, making it easier to work with complex datasets and perform various operations such as adding, removing, and accessing elements.
